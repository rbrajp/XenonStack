Step 1: UI Development
Design User Interface (UI): Create HTML files (login.html, contactus.html, signup.html) for each page. Style them using CSS (login.css, contactus.css, signup.css) to ensure an appealing layout and user-friendly design.
Step 2: Backend Setup
Node.js Backend Setup: Initiate a Node.js project. Set up the necessary dependencies using npm (or yarn). Install packages like Express for server setup and Mongoose for MongoDB connection handling.
Step 3: Server and Routing
Server & Routing: Use Express.js to set up routes for handling different page requests (GET and POST methods) such as /login, /contactus, /signup. Configure these routes to render the respective HTML files.
Step 4: Database Integration
Database Integration: Establish a connection with MongoDB using Mongoose. Create schemas and models to represent user data. Implement logic in your routes to perform CRUD operations (Create, Update) on the database. For instance, upon user signup, insert their details into the database.
Step 5: UI-Backend Integration
Connect UI with Backend: Set up form submissions from your HTML pages to send data to the backend. Utilize JavaScript to handle form submissions. Upon form submission, send the data to the respective backend route (e.g., /login, /signup). Process this data in your Node.js backend routes and interact with the database (like storing login/signup information).
By following these steps, you'll have a structured process where the user interface is well-designed and interacts seamlessly with the backend server, enabling data flow between the UI and the MongoDB database.
